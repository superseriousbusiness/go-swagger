# Swagger 2.0

---

This project contains a golang implementation of Swagger 2.0 (aka [OpenAPI 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/old-v3.2.0-dev/versions/2.0.md)).
It provide tools to work with swagger specifications.

[Swagger](https://swagger.io/) is a simple yet powerful representation of your RESTful API.<br>

## Documentation

<https://goswagger.io>

##  Features

`go-swagger` brings to the go community a complete suite of fully-featured, high-performance, API components to  work with a Swagger API: server, client and data model.

* Generates a server from a swagger specification
* Generates a client from a swagger specification
* Generates a CLI (command line tool) from a swagger specification (alpha stage)
* Supports most features offered by jsonschema and swagger, including polymorphism
* Generates a swagger specification from annotated go code
* Additional tools to work with a swagger spec
* Great customization features, with vendor extensions and customizable templates

Our focus with code generation is to produce idiomatic, fast go code, which plays nice with golint, go vet etc.

##  Project status

This project supports OpenAPI 2.0. **At this moment it does not support OpenAPI 3.x**.

`go-swagger` is now feature complete and has stabilized its API.

Most features and building blocks are now in a stable state, with a rich set of CI tests.

The go-openapi community actively continues bringing fixes and enhancements to this code base.

There is still much room for improvement: contributors and PR's are welcome. You may also get in touch with maintainers on [our slack channel](https://slackin.goswagger.io).
